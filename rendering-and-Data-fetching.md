# Pre-rendering 
is the most important feature in next.js , This means that Next.js generates HTML for each page in server side , instead of having it all done by client-side JavaScript. Pre-rendering can result in better performance and SEO. Each generated HTML is associated with minimal JavaScript code necessary for that page.
