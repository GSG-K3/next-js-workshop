# Pre-rendering 
is the most important feature in next.js, This means that Next.js generates HTML for each page in server-side , instead of having it all done by client-side JavaScript. Pre-rendering can result in better performance and SEO. Each generated HTML is associated with minimal JavaScript code necessary for that page.

The main difference between React and  Next.js is where the render happens

    - in React the render happens on the browser
    - in Next Js the render happens on Server

# Rre-rendering Types

Next.js has two type  of pre-rendering: 

    - Static Generation 
    - Server-side Rendering.
    
The difference is in when it generates the HTML for a page.

- Static Generation is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at build time, and reused Html page  on each request.
- Server-side Rendering is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on each request.

# When to Use Static Generation VS Server-side Rendering

Next js recommend using Static Generation (with and without data , we will take about it later)  which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.
#### Static Generation used with : 
    - Static html pages
    - the pages that contains a data that doesn't change frequently

#### You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:

    - Marketing pages
    - Blog posts
    - Help and documentation
    
On the other hand, Server-side Rendering is a good idea if your a page shows frequently updated data , and the page content changes on every request,
In that case, you can use Server-Side Rendering. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date.

# Working with Data Fetching

we talked about Pre-rendering (Static Generation and Server-side Rendering) , and now we’ll talk in depths about data fetching strategies for each case .
We’ll talk about the three unique Next.js functions you can use to fetch data for pre-rendering:

 - #### `getStaticProps` : use with Static Generation to Fetch data at build time.
 - #### `getStaticPaths` : use with Static Generation in dynamic routes to define a list of paths that have to be rendered to HTML at build time.
 - #### `getServerSideProps` : use with Server-side Rendering to  Fetch data on each request.

 ###### we will take in depths about this unique Next.js functions

# Static Generation types

![static-generation-without-data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7718220/89324424-ee9aa100-d68f-11ea-9aab-764b93d3783f.png)


![static-generation-with-data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7718220/89324469-0114da80-d690-11ea-8aaf-570ee06937b0.png)

# `getStaticProps` Function

#### `getStaticProps` tell Next.js: “Hey, this page has some data dependencies — so when you pre-render this page at build time, make sure to resolve them first!”

to run `getStaticProps` we must export an `async function` called `getStaticProps` from a page, the data return from functions will uaing as props by Next.js in pre-render of page at build time.

In the following example we will export `async function getStaticProps` to fetch all post from [json place holder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts).
the Function takes `context` parameter and returns `posts` and `revalidate` as props to use in the component to build post List 
      
### Let's try using `getStaticProps` in code

- clone this repo
- run these commands :
```
cd next-js-workshop
cd example
cd data-fetching-example
```

install dependencies

```
npm install
```

run next server in development
```
npm run dev
```

#### open Index.js file in the Pages Folder , add the code below , to create index component with `getStaticProps` function to get List of post


```js
import axios from 'axios';
import Link from 'next/link';

// get all post from json place holder Api to build Post Link List
// This function gets called at build time on server-side.
// It won't be called on client-side, so you can even do
// direct database queries.
export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  const res = await axios.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
  return {
  // will be passed to the page component as props
    props: { posts: res.data },
    // Next.js will attempt to re-generate the page:
    // - When a request comes in
    // - At most once every 10 second
    revalidate: 10, // In seconds
  };
}

// React Hooks Component take props and build List of Post 
const Index = (props) => {

  // check if props contains posts object    
  if (!props.posts) {
    return ( <h1>There is no any Post</h1> );
  }
  
  return (
      <div>
        <h1>Welcome Blog Posts Next Js App </h1>
        // Build List of Posts 
        <ul>
          {props.posts.map((post, index) => {
            return (
              <li key={index}>
               <Link href={`/posts/${post.id}`}>{post.title}</Link>
              </li>
            );
          })}
        </ul>
      </div>
  );
};

export default Index;

```

###### opne the browser and enter http://localhost:3000/ , you must see list of post 

![nerxt-post](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7718220/89521700-a773f380-d7e8-11ea-969f-4bee8f7c6302.jpg)



###### Note: by using `revalidate`  the list of blog posts will be re-validated once per 10 seconds; if you add a new blog post it will be available almost immediately, without having to re-build your app or make a new deployment.



# When should I use `getStaticProps`?

- The data required to render the page is available at build time ahead of a user’s request.
- The data comes from external sources Like API.
- The data can be publicly cached (not user-specific).
- The page must be pre-rendered (for SEO) and be very fast.




# Statically Generates both HTML and JSON
#### When a page with `getStaticProps` is pre-rendered at build time, in addition to the HTML file, Next.js generates a JSON file holding the result of running getStaticProps.

This JSON file will be used in client-side routing through `next/link` or `next/router` to page . When you navigate to a page that’s pre-rendered using getStaticProps, Next.js fetches this JSON file (pre-computed at build time) and uses it as the props for the page component. This means that client-side page transitions will not call getStaticProps as only the exported JSON is used.



# `getStaticPaths` (Static Generation)

`getStaticPaths` use with page has dynamic routes, this function is define a list of all paths that have to be rendered to HTML at build time.

to run `getStaticPaths` we must  export an `async function` called `getStaticPaths` from a page that uses dynamic routes, Next.js will statically pre-render all the paths specified by `getStaticPaths`.

```js

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const res = await axios('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
  
  //to build path of all post
  const paths = res.data.map((post) => {
    return `/posts/${post.id}`;
  });
  // return all paths to build html file 
  return { paths, fallback: true };
}

```

#### The `getStaticPaths` function  must return The `paths` and `fallback` key 

# paths
The paths key determines which paths will be pre-rendered

For example, suppose that you have a page that uses dynamic routes named `/posts/[id].js`. If you export `getStaticPaths` from this page and return the following for paths:

```js
// note thant the proporty in params same name with 
return {
  paths: [
    { params: { id: '1' } },
    { params: { id: '2' } },
    { params: { id: '3' } },
    { params: { id: '4' } },
    ....
  ],
}
```

Then Next.js will statically generate `posts/1` ,  `posts/2` , `posts/3` , `posts/4` , ... at build time using the page component in `pages/posts/[id].js`.

 **note that the Name of property id  in params same name with dynamic routes named**
> [id].js -->  { params: { id: '1' } }

> [pid].js --> { params: { pid: '1' } }

# fallback
is the boolean property must returned from  `getStaticPaths`


#### `fallback: false`

If fallback is false, then any paths are not returned by `getStaticPaths` will result in a 404 page. You can do this if you have a small number of paths to pre-render - so they are all statically generated during build time. It’s also useful when the new pages are not added often. If you add more items to the data source and need to render the new pages, you’d need to run the build again.


#### `fallback: true`

If fallback is true, then the behavior of `getStaticProps` changes:

- The paths returned from `getStaticPaths` will be rendered to HTML at build time.
- The paths that have not been generated at build time will not result in a 404 page. 
- In the background, Next.js will statically generate the requested path HTML and JSON. This includes running `getStaticProps`.
- When that’s done, the browser receives the JSON for the generated path. This will be used to automatically render the page with the required props. From the user’s perspective, the page will be swapped from the fallback page to the full page.
- At the same time, Next.js adds this path to the list of pre-rendered pages. Subsequent requests to the same path will serve the generated page, just like other pages pre-rendered at build time.


### When is fallback: true useful?
fallback: true is useful if your app has a very large number of static pages that depend on data (think: a very large e-commerce site). You want to pre-render all product pages, but then your builds would take forever.

Instead, you may statically generate a small subset of pages and use fallback: true for the rest. When someone requests a page that’s not generated yet, the user will see the page with a loading indicator. Shortly after, `getStaticProps` finishes and the page will be rendered with the requested data. From now on, everyone who requests the same page will get the statically pre-rendered page. This ensures that users always have a fast experience while preserving fast builds and the benefits of Static Generation.




# `getServerSideProps` (Server-side Rendering)
 
using `getServerSideProps` (Server-side Rendering) if we  will need to fetch data at request time instead of at build time ,
to run `getServerSideProps` we must  export an `async function` called `getServerSideProps` from a page, Next.js will pre-render this page on each request using the data returned by `getServerSideProps`.

![server-side-rendering-with-data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7718220/89445002-405c2d80-d75b-11ea-8dd2-52fca870dbdc.png)

```js

// Demo to get User Profile Data by userId at Server Side 
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const res = await axios.get(`/profile/${context.params.userId}`);
  return {
    props: { posts: res.data },
  };
}

```

Because `getServerSideProps` is called at request time, its take parameter (context) object containing the following keys :

- If the page uses dynamic routes name like `[userId].js` , then params will look like `params : { userId: ... }`.
- req: The HTTP IncomingMessage object.
- res: The HTTP response object.
- query: The query string.

### When should I use getServerSideProps?
You should use `getServerSideProps` only if you need to pre-render a page which includes a data must be fetched at request time. The first Time will be slower than getStaticProps because the server must compute the result on every request, and the result cannot be cached by a CDN without extra configuration.
