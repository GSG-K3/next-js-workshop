# Pre-rendering 
is the most important feature in next.js , This means that Next.js generates HTML for each page in server side , instead of having it all done by client-side JavaScript. Pre-rendering can result in better performance and SEO. Each generated HTML is associated with minimal JavaScript code necessary for that page.

The main difference between Next.js and react is where the render happens

    - in React the render happen in browser
    - in Next Js the render happen in Server
