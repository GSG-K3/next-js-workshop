pages is a directory but it's not like the other directories

Next.js has a file-system based router built on the concept of pages, When a file is added to the pages directory it's automatically available as a route,
The files inside the pages directory can be used to define most common patterns.


## react-router-dom VS next.js Routing 
in react we used the react-router-dom to create pages and navigate between them

in next.js it's different , //about it ..

in `pages` every file is mapped to a bath

// some examples....

`pages/index` = `"/"`

`pages/about/index.js` = `"/about"`
### try it by yourself 
- clone this repo 
- cd in to the next-js-workshop then cd example then pages-example 
- run the command npm install
- run the command 
```
npm install next react react-dom
```
- Open package.json and add the following scripts:
```
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start"
}
```
- you can now run the project by using the command `npm run dev` 
- inside this folder add a file with the name `index.js`
- inside this file add this code 
```
function HomePage() {
  return <h1>Welcome to Next.js!</h1>
}

export default HomePage
```
- check the `localhost:3000`
- now create a folder with the name of `about.js`
- inside this folder add a function that returns any string and don't forget to export this function 
- now check your `localhost:3000/about` 

it's there :)
