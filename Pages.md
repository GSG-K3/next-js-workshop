Next.js has a file-system based router built on the concept of pages,
When a file is added to the pages directory it's automatically available as a route,
The files inside the pages directory can be used to define most common patterns.

## REACT-ROUTER-DOM VS NEXT.JS ROUTING 
in react we had use the react-router-dom to create pages and navigate between them
