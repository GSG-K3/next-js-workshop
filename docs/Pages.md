# pages

Next.js has a file-system based router built on the concept of pages.
When a file is added to the pages directory it's automatically available as a route.
The files inside the pages directory can be used to define most common patterns.


## react-router-dom VS next.js Routing 
in react we used the react-router-dom to create pages and navigate between them

in next.js it's different . a page is a react component exported from a file in the pages directory. Each page is associated with a route based on its file name.

**in `pages` every file is mapped to a path**

 # Links 
 in react we used links to navigate between pages 
 ```js 
 <Link to="/">Home</Link>
 ```
 in next.js the links are used with a little difference 
 ```js
 <Link href="/"><a>Home</a></Link>
 ```
  **href** is the path inside `pages` directory. This is the only required prop.
 

# try it by yourself 
- clone this repo 
- run these commands :
```
cd next-js-workshop
cd example
cd pages example 
```
install dependencies 
```
npm install
```
install nextjs and react 
```
npm install next react react-dom
```
- Open package.json and add the following scripts:
```js 
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start"
}
```
- you can now run the project by using the command `npm run dev` 
- inside the pages folder you can find the `index.js` file that is the default path and will include our home page 

```
pages/index.js = "/"
```
inside the `index.js file` add the following code :

```js
function HomePage() {
  return <h1>Welcome to Next.js!</h1>
}

export default HomePage
```
- check the `localhost:3000`
- now create a folder with the name of `about.js`
- inside this folder add a function that returns any string , and don't forget to export this function 
- now check your `localhost:3000/about` *and make sure that the file name matches the path name*

  it's there :fire: just as easy as that
  
  
  we will talk about *Index routes* and *Nested routes* later in this workshop , but this should give you a general idea of how next.js Routing works.
